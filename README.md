# AE2 Network Designs Repository

Welcome to the **AE2 Network Designs Repository**! This repository is a community-driven collection of AE2 network diagrams for modded Minecraft players. The aim is to provide a shared space where players can showcase their AE2 setups, learn from others, and improve their own network designs.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Share and exchange AE2 network designs.
- Provide a visual resource for players looking to optimize or inspire their own setups.
- Collaborate on improving and expanding custom draw.io shapes specifically for AE2 components.
- Enlighten beginners on the nuance, and late-game implications of ME Network design decisions.

3. **Add Your AE2 Network Diagram**:
   - Create your network diagram in draw.io and save it as both a `.drawio` and `.svg` file.

## Using the Template

To maintain consistency across diagrams and ensure all files are easy to understand and edit, we have a standard template format:
- [Click Here](https://app.diagrams.net/#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDeMux42%2FAE2NetworkDesigns%2Fmain%2FAE2NetworkDesignExamples%2FTemplate.drawio)
- **Diagram Files**: Each diagram should have both a `.drawio` file for editing and a `.svg` file for viewing.
- **README Updates**: Every time you add a new diagram, update the README in the "AE2 Network Designs" folder:
  - List your diagram under a new section, including both a link to the `.drawio` file and an inline render of the `.svg` file.
  - Ensure filenames are URL-encoded if they contain spaces or special characters (e.g., `%20` for spaces and `%27` for apostrophes).
