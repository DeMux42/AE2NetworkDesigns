# AE2 Network Designs Repository

Welcome to the **AE2 Network Designs Repository**! This repository is a community-driven collection of AE2 network diagrams for modded Minecraft players. The aim is to provide a shared space where players can showcase how they like to set up their AE2 networks, learn from others, and improve their own network designs.

**Check out the [AE2 Designs folder](./AE2NetworkDesignExamples/)!** Here you'll find all the contributed AE2 network designs and the template to create your own.


## Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

- Enlighten beginners on the strategy, nuance, and implications of ME Network design decisions.
- Share and exchange AE2 network designs.
- Provide a visual resource for players looking to optimize or inspire their own setups.

## How to Contribute

The community needs your expertise! Follow these steps to contribute your AE2 network diagram:

### Step 1: Create and Save Your Diagram

1. **Start with the Template**: [Click Here](https://app.diagrams.net/#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDeMux42%2FAE2NetworkDesigns%2Fmain%2FAE2NetworkDesignExamples%2FTemplate-AwesomeMinecrafter%27s%20AE2%20Network%20Design.drawio) to open a new draw.io diagram using the Design Template.
2. **Edit Your Diagram**: Customize the template in draw.io to showcase your preferred AE2 architecture.
3. **Save Your Work**: After editing, download both the `.drawio` file for future editing and a `.svg` file for viewing. Remove "Template-" from the filenames and update your name instead!

## Contribute to Custom Draw.io Shapes

We have included a separate file for creating custom draw.io shapes specifically for AE2 network components. These shapes are basic and are meant to be a starting point. We welcome any enhancements or new shapes you can contribute!

To learn more and see the existing custom shapes, please refer to the [Draw.io Custom Shapes](./Draw.io%20Custom%20Shapes.md) file.

**We look forward to your contributions and helping build a valuable resource for the AE2 and Minecraft community!**
